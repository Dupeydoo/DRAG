        <h1>Track Rating for Generation {{ currentgeneration }}</h1>
        <p>As in biological evolution only the fittest candidates survive! Listen to tracks
            and assign them a quality rating between 0 and 10. Click submit when you are finished. You may
            listen to the first 9 tracks with numeric key shortcuts (pressing 1 will play track 1). You
            can also use the tab key to switch between fitness inputs fast.

            Each track can be navigated easily in a grid system by using shift + a directional key to switch
            from track to track. Once a track is in focus you may use the Enter or Space key to play the track.</p>
